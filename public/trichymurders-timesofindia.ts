PollMK Stalin says ATM withdrawal charges hike negates financial inclusion of poor.AgreeDisagreeJegansbabu was found dead on the railway track between Golden Rock Railway Station and Trichy Railway Junction in the early hours of July 8.The 'forced' marriage of Ajitha, a nurse at a private hospital in Chennai with Jegansbabu, a Singapore-return mason, in June this year and her 'unforgettable' love with her colleague John Prince, a nurse at the same hospital, were the reason behind the murder, a police officer told TOI.    by Taboolaby TaboolaSponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksYou May LikeInvest $200 in Amazon without buying stocks to earn a second salaryMarketsallSign UpUndo\"A few days after the marriage, Ajitha left for work in Chennai and met her lover to express her unwillingness to continue with the married life. They decided to murder Jegansbabu and lead a new life. John befriended Jegansbabu over phone by pretending to be a doctor at the hospital where Ajitha works and invited him to attend a feast for the newly-married couple in Chennai on July 8,\" the officer said.Believing his words, Jegansbabu started his journey to Chennai in the night of July 7 in Kanyakumari Express. \"With the intention to kill him on the way, John also came to Kanyakumari under the guise of picking him up. When they reached Trichy, John told Jegansbabu that they can go by a car from Trichy. Trusting the 'doctor', Jegansbabu followed John, who took him to the railway track and strangled him to death using a kerchief. To make it look like a suicide, he placed the body on the track so that a train will run over it. However, the pilot of Ananthapuri Express spotted the body and stopped the train,\" the officer added.GRP, Trichy, recovered the body and listed it as a suspected suicide.The circulation of the picture of the body found on the track was the turning point, as Jegansbabu's parents suspected foul play. They made Ajitha lodge a complaint with the GRP, Trichy, raising suspicion over the death and demanded an investigation into the matter. The investigation landed Ajitha and John in trouble. They were produced in a Trichy court and lodged in separate prisons on Friday night."

She had sought CBI investigation into the case. If CB-CID is unable to zero in on the accused, the case might be transferred to CBI by the court. CB-CID took up the case after the state government transferred it from the Trichy city police as there was no headway in the case for nearly three months after the murder.

Stalin's comment came at a time when dissentions were brewing from a section of against fielding Mahesh in Thiruverumbur constituency. The 63 year old leader was in Trichy to campaign in seven of nine constituencies in Trichy today. Manapparai constituency was not on the list of his campaign.Kick-starting his whirlwind campaign in Trichy west constituency, he said that Trichy always proved to be a turning point for DMK right from the beginning. DMK's Trichy strongman KN Nehru is contesting in the constituency. Criticizing the law and order situation in state, Stalin raked up the high-profiled murder of Nehru's younger brother KN Ramajayam four years back. \"The murder of Ramajayam and no headway in the case for four years show the situation of the law and order in the state,\" said Stalin.He wrapped up his campaign for the Trichy east constituency for the congress candidate G Jerome Arockiaraj within few minutes. Lashing out at AIADMK for scrapping the memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Bharat Heavy Electrical Limited (BHEL), Trichy for 1600 mw Udankudi project implementing development schemes in Trichy, Stalin assured to bring in many schemes including integrated bus stand, auto nagar, protection wall in Koraiyaru, cauvery combined water system, flower market in Srirangam.\"MoU with Udankudi project was initiated by the DMK government. So, Jayalalithaa did not want the scheme to materialize and she scrapped it on her birthday on February 24, 2012. If DMK comes to power, the project will again implement the project,\" he said. Stalin raised serious concerns over the notification of state bank of India (SBI) to prevent the education loan defaulters from taking up the competitive exams conducted for the employment in the nationalized bank. \"Considering the plight of students and with a vision in mind, DMK leader Kalaignar waived the education loan to help out the students,\" he said. In his campaign in Lalgudi an agriculture belt, Stalin said \"Despite having 39 MPs, the AIADMK failed to set up cauvery water management board. Ironically, Jayalalithaa was called as Ponniyin Selvi,\" he said besides assuring to revive the IT park constructed on a 141.61 acres in DMK regime in Navalpattu.Citing the ongoing trial in appeal in Supreme Court against the acquittal of Jayalalithaa in disproportionate assets case, Stalin said that the sword of Damocles was hanging on her head in the case."

Police suspect the hand of one 'Vatti' Prabhu in the murder, who might have committed the crime as a retaliatory act over business dealings.PollMK Stalin says ATM withdrawal charges hike negates financial inclusion of poor.AgreeDisagreeAccording to police, Prabhu, who is presently active in Trichy region and is involved in the conduct of kangaroo courts was said to be at loggerheads with Murugesan.

A special branch officer said the incident would certainly trigger off acts of revenge sooner than later. Murugesan (42) had gained notoriety for beheading his rivals. After burying the torso, he would place the head of the murdered person at a strategic place to send a chilling warning to his opponents including 38-year-old Vatti Prabhu.

Two years later, Murugesan retaliated by killing three men of Prabhu's gang at Kalligudi, a special branch police said. Interestingly, the police said that Monday's murder was committed at a time when Murugesan had been freed of all cases and a lull in criminal activities after his marriage. Thereafter, he had shifted his modus operandi from running the kangaroo courts to settle disputes arising out of jallikattu tournaments and extorting money from political personalities. At the instance of politicians, the police were also collecting evidence to book him under the Goodas Act.

We hope that we can get more information about the case,\" said P Malaichamy, deputy superintendent of police (DSP), CB-CID. Muthukathan, the other accomplice, is no more. The charred bodies of Durairaj and his driver were recovered by the police from near Vaiyampatti on the outskirts of Trichy on January 22, 2007. As the investigation did not make any headway, the case was later transferred to CB-CID which also couldn't make any breakthrough though they had interrogated a few suspects, including Kannan. He was suspected as the last call to Durairaj came from his mobile phone on January 22. During the probe in 2007, Kannan had told police he had dialled Durairaj to discuss about his horoscope. The investigators, who saw the murders as a result of business rivalry, shifted the focus from Kannan and let him off. On Thursday, Kannan confessed that he murdered Durairaj and Sakthivel at the residence of Yamuna. \"Kannan confessed that he murdered the duo as Durairaj too was maintaining a relation with her.

Later, near Vaiyampatti they set on fire the car in which the bodies of the duo were kept. He had said the car rammed into a tree and caught fire,\" said Malaichamy. With the confession of Kannan, police have now booked him for the murder of five people, including Yamuna's husband Thangavel.

Narrating a specific incident, the activists accused the police team from Madurai for falsely implicating two Muslim youth in the murder case of Murugan, a Hindu outfit leader near Paramakudi. In an effort to implicate the two - Ithris and Madar Sikhander - of Idaikattur village as murder accused, the team allegedly detained two Hindu youth who were released from prison on bail. The Hindu youth were threatened by police to testify against Ithris and Madar in the guise of shooting them dead in an encounter. Following this, they agreed and were brought before the Trichy magistrate to testify. However, the youth narrated their plight to some advocates in the court who presented it to the judge. The judicial court II in Trichy after hearing the youth ordered the CBCID to investigate those charges against the special team headed by Madasamy.

Though police claimed that the box contained explosive materials, the police carried out the raid very secretly which created several doubts on the police theory, Marx pointed out.

Addressing media persons here on Monday, A Marx, a human rights activist said the team conducted a study of the situation in Nelpettai in Madurai and Melapalayam in Tirunelveli, where Muslims live in large numbers and were shocked to see the police excesses.PollMK Stalin says ATM withdrawal charges hike negates financial inclusion of poor.AgreeDisagree The special investigation teams headed by Madurai ADSP, Myilvaganan and inspector Madasamy were involved in torturing innocent Muslims, detaining them under unlawful custodies and filing false cases against them. The poor Muslims were detained in the name of investigation and they were physically tortured. The photographs, mobile phone details and personal information are being collected, Marx alleged.  Narrating a specific incident, the activists accused the police team from Madurai for falsely implicating two Muslim youth in the murder case of Murugan, a Hindu outfit leader near Paramakudi. In an effort to implicate the two - Ithris and Madar Sikhander - of Idaikattur village as murder accused, the team allegedly detained two Hindu youth who were released from prison on bail. The Hindu youth were threatened by police to testify against Ithris and Madar in the guise of shooting them dead in an encounter. Following this, they agreed and were brought before the Trichy magistrate to testify. However, the youth narrated their plight to some advocates in the court who presented it to the judge. The judicial court II in Trichy after hearing the youth ordered the CBCID to investigate those charges against the special team headed by Madasamy.  In the same way, the Tirunelveli special team raided Melapalayam area in a case related to the arrest of Muslim youth and seized Rs 6 lakh cash and a suspicious box. Though police claimed that the box contained explosive materials, the police carried out the raid very secretly which created several doubts on the police theory, Marx pointed out.  Hence the activists demanded the CBI to investigate the murder of BJP leaders for more transparent investigation. They also demanded that Madurai ADSP, Mayilvaganan and Madasamy be suspended from their duties till the CBCID team investigates the case filed in the Trichy court."
